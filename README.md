# Bitwise Operators Practice

This repository contains problems and solutions related to **bitwise operators** in programming. Bitwise operators are used for performing bit-level operations, which are often more efficient than arithmetic operations. This document provides an overview of bitwise operators, their usage, and related problems.

## **Introduction to Bitwise Operators**

Bitwise operators operate on the binary representations of integers. These are the fundamental bitwise operators:

### **1. AND (`&`)**
- Compares each bit of two numbers and returns `1` if both bits are `1`, otherwise returns `0`.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  5 & 3 // Binary: 101 & 011 = 001 -> Result: 1
  5 | 3 // Binary: 101 | 011 = 111 -> Result: 7
  5 ^ 3 // Binary: 101 ^ 011 = 110 -> Result: 6
  ~5 // Binary: ~00000101 = 11111010 (in 8-bit representation) -> Result: -6
  5 << 1 // Binary: 101 << 1 = 1010 -> Result: 10
  5 >> 1 // Binary: 101 >> 1 = 10 -> Result: 2
